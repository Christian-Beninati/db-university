# DB University

Today's exercise: DB University
Repo name: db-university

Model the structure of a database to store all the data regarding a university:

- There are several departments (e.g.: Literature and Philosophy, Mathematics, Engineering, etc.);
- Each department offers multiple degree courses (e.g.: Classical Civilization and Literature, Computer Science, Electronic Engineering, etc.);
- Each degree course includes multiple courses (e.g.: Latin Literature, Operating Systems 1, Mathematical Analysis 2, etc.);
- Each course can be taught by multiple teachers;
- Each course includes multiple exam sessions;
- Each student is enrolled in a single degree course;
- Each student can enroll in multiple exam sessions;
- For each exam session in which the student has participated, it is necessary to store the grade obtained, even if it is not sufficient.

Let's think about which entities (tables) to create for our database and then try to establish their relationships. Finally, let's define the columns and data types of each table.

Use https://www.diagrams.net/ to create the schema. Then export the diagram in jpg and upload it to the repo.
